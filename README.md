# üíº DistilBERT Job Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation of a fine-tuned **DistilBERT** model that extracts skills from user input (like resumes, bios, or free text) and recommends suitable job roles using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## üîç Project Overview

This project is designed to help users find relevant jobs based on their mentioned skills or experiences. It uses a transformer-based language model (**DistilBERT**) trained/fine-tuned for:

- Extracting and classifying skill-related information
- Matching those skills to job categories
- Recommending job roles accordingly

## üß† Model Info

- **Base Model:** DistilBERT (from HuggingFace Transformers)
- **Task:** Skill Classification + Job Recommendation
- **Framework:** PyTorch
- **Trained On:** Custom dataset containing user skills and job mappings
